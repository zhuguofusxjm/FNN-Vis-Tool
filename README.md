The FNN algorithm is a commonly used neural network algorithm, and creating illustrations of neural network architectures is often time-consuming. This tool provides a graphical visualization capability using the D3 JavaScript library. Users can generate corresponding multi-layer views by customizing Excel data.

I hope this tool can save time for machine learning researchers and also serve as an educational tool in certain scenarios.
